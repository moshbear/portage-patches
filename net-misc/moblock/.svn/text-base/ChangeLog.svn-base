  +files/moblock-0.8-fix-nfq_unbind_pf-error.patch, metadata.xml:
  See bug #143535 for discussion and history.
  * Fixed broken scripts by sourcing functions.sh from /etc/init.d instead
    of /sbin since it was moved in >sys-apps/baselayout-2.0.0 (thanks also
    to Zorzo Luca <lucazorzo@gmail.com> and Santiago M. Mola)
  * Fix compiler error "'INT_MIN' undeclared here (not in a function)" by
    manually including limits.h, although this appears to have been a bug
    in sys-kernel/linux-headers (thanks also to Zorzo Luca).
  * Fix error "iptables: No chain/target/match by that name" by adding
    NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_STATE to CONFIG_CHECK (thanks to Zorzo Luca).
  * Fix error "error during nfq_unbind_pf()" on 2.6.23 and later kernels
    (it is actually expected now and ignored).
  * Added options to specify additional white and black list ranges via
    {WHITE,BLACK}_IP_{IN,OUT,FORWARD} variables in conf.d (thanks to Alan
    Pastor <t7gt7g@gmail.com> and From Gabriel Devenyi <ace@staticwave.ca>).
  * moblock-update will spend less time on servers that are down (happens a
    lot). This can be tweaked via WGET_EXTRA_OPTIONS in /etc/conf.d/moblock.
  * Modified the overall scheme that moblock-update uses so we can include
    iblocklist.org as a mirror, which likes to prepends "bt_" to their file
    names.
  * Renamed "templist" blocklist to "badpeers" in conf.d to match change on
    servers.
  * Added new blocklists "gnutella" and "webexploit-forumspam" to conf.d.
  * Added new files /etc/conf.d/moblock.{minimal,normal,parinoid}.example.
    By default, the "normal" version is copied to /etc/conf.d/moblock during
    install.
  * Added USE flag "logrotate" USE flag that installs an
    /etc/logrotate/moblock file and pulls in app-admin/logrotate (thanks to
    Peter Avramucz <muczyjoe@gmail.com> and Marc Elser
    <melser_regs@gmxpro.net>)
  * Added USE flag "network-cron" which installs a link to moblock-update in
    /etc/cron-weekly.
  * Added USE flag "paranoid" use flag that changes the cron job to daily
    and causes the parinoid configuration file to be used in conf.d.
  * Modified moblock-stats slightly because in some cases tail is claiming
    it can't find file - (dash) when redirecting that file to it.
  * Modified ebuild to restart moblock after install if moblock is running.

  Addresses issues in bug #143535
  * Added update script (credit also to Jonathan Schroeder & Peter Avramucz)
  * Fixed bugs in init.d as per comment #7
    - changed PID to PIDFILE
    - removed call to modprobe
  * Added script to extract stats from MoBlock daemon
  * Updated conf.d file, added blocklist servers and the lists with
    descriptions
  * ebuild now checks for needed kernel options and iptables (thanks Nathan
    Caldwell)
  * Moved some files and directories around to better adhere to FHS
    (http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html)
    - Moved compiled blocklist file from /etc/moblock to /var/db/moblock
    - Downloaded blocklist files now go in /var/cache/moblock
    - Removed /etc/moblock dir
  * Added ~amd64 KEYWORD
  TODO list:
  * Downloaded lists in /var/cache/moblock not deleted when unmerged.  If we
    do delete them, this will force them to re-download when upgrading.
  * Should log files be removed when unmerging? -- currently commented out.
  * Is exclusions list being handled correctly?
