# Output statistics from MoBlock daemon.
#
# This script is screwy enough that it deserves some documentation.  To get
# statistics from the moblock daemon, you send it SIGUSR2 (man signal(7) for
# more info).  This causes moblock to output the statistics to
# /var/log/moblock.stats.  So this suicidal script sends SIGUSR2 to Moblock,
# scrapes the .stats file and sends SIGINT to it's self when it finds text
# that indicates the end of the report has been reached. tail is started
# with --pid=$$ so we're sure it dies when we do and read_stat_log will
# actually terminate normally, after telling it's parent to go away (typical
# teen).
#
# It's screwy, but effective.
